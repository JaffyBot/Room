# Room
The old-school adventure game (built with Python)

This is a text-based adventure game in Python. 

Gameplay: you play as an adventurer and walk around the rooms while solving puzzles along the way.

Goal: get to the HQ room to meet the fairy (or try to score high by picking up items).

Feature: Data saving and data reading features are supported. (Yes, you can save and load your game progress!)

Hint/tip: During the game, make sure you have an algorithm-related item in the inventory before heading into the "recursion" room - or the adventurer will be forever trapped in a world of recursion.
